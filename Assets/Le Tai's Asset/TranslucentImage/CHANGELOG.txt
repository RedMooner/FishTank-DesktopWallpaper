Changelog:

v3.1.1:
 - Fix issue with URP Post Processing

v3.1.0:
 *** Breaking change for LWRP project ***
 - If you're using the asset in an existing LWRP project, please delete its folder first and import it again to avoid issue.
 - If you're using the "Demo Forward Renderer" and "Demo LightweightRenderPipelineAsset", you'll have to replace them with the new one located in "Universal RP/'Configs" folder. I recommend creating your own, specific to your project.
 ***
